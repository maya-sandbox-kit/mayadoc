**White Paper: How Maya Differs from Other Frameworks (Angular, Next.js, React, Vue.js, etc.)**

## **Introduction**
Maya is a **Micro Front-End (MFE) framework** that offers a **simpler, modular, and dynamic** approach to web application development. Unlike traditional frameworks such as **Angular, Next.js, React, and Vue.js**, which focus on monolithic or component-based structures, Maya is built around **event-driven, slot-based dynamic loading**, making it fundamentally different in both architecture and execution.

This paper explores the **key differences** between Maya and other frameworks, highlighting **simplicity, modularity, and dynamic capabilities**.

## **1. Architectural Differences: Monolithic vs. Micro Front-End (MFE)**
| **Feature** | **Maya** | **Angular / React / Vue / Next.js** |
|------------|---------|----------------------------------|
| **Architecture** | Micro Front-End (MFE) | Component-Based / Monolithic |
| **Page Structure** | Dynamically loaded MFEs using slots | Predefined component trees |
| **State Management** | Global store (`Maya.Store`), event-driven | Redux, Context API, Vuex, or Angular services |
| **Rendering Strategy** | One-way data binding (`self`) | Two-way (Vue), Virtual DOM (React), Hybrid (Angular) |
| **Inter-Component Communication** | Pub/Sub model (`Maya.Store.Publish/Subscribe`) | Props (React), State Management (Vue, Angular) |

‚úÖ **Why Maya is Simpler?**
- No need to manage a component tree; MFEs load dynamically where needed.
- No need for complex state management solutions like Redux or Vuex.
- Built-in **event-driven communication**, eliminating excessive prop drilling.

---
## **2. Dynamic Loading vs. Static Component Rendering**
| **Feature** | **Maya** | **Angular / React / Vue / Next.js** |
|------------|---------|----------------------------------|
| **Component Loading** | Dynamic (`Maya.Load()`, `Maya.Route()`) | Static component hierarchy |
| **Slot-Based UI Composition** | Uses `<maya-slot>` for flexible UI rendering | Uses predefined component trees |
| **Multi-Instance Support** | Allows multiple MFEs in the same slot | Requires manual state duplication |

‚úÖ **Why Maya is Simpler?**
- **No need for client-side routing libraries** (like React Router, Angular Router).
- **MFE instances load and unload dynamically**, without needing complex parent-child communication.
- **No need for server-side rendering (SSR) optimizations** like in Next.js or Nuxt.js.

---
## **3. State Management: Centralized and Automatic**
| **Feature** | **Maya** | **Angular / React / Vue / Next.js** |
|------------|---------|----------------------------------|
| **State Management** | `Maya.Store` with `self` (one-way binding) | Redux, Vuex, Context API, Services |
| **Shared State** | `Maya.Store.SetSharedData()` for caching | Global state or prop drilling |
| **Automatic Input Syncing** | Yes (via `self`) | No (needs event listeners) |

‚úÖ **Why Maya is Simpler?**
- **No need for Redux, MobX, Vuex, or Context API**‚Äîeverything is handled via `Maya.Store`.
- **Input fields automatically sync to state**, eliminating the need for manual event listeners.
- **Data is stored persistently**, reducing re-fetching and improving performance.

---
## **4. Event Handling & Communication: Pub/Sub vs. Props & State**
| **Feature** | **Maya** | **Angular / React / Vue / Next.js** |
|------------|---------|----------------------------------|
| **Event Handling** | Pub/Sub (`Maya.Store.Publish/Subscribe`) | Prop drilling, state callbacks |
| **Component Communication** | Event-driven, independent MFEs | Tight coupling via props, hooks, services |
| **Input Handling** | Auto-syncs to `Maya.Store.self<key>` | Requires controlled components & event handlers |

‚úÖ **Why Maya is Simpler?**
- **Eliminates prop drilling** (common issue in React & Vue).
- **Global event-driven model** allows independent MFEs to communicate seamlessly.
- **No need for `useEffect()`, `onMounted()`, or dependency arrays** to handle updates.

---
## **5. Performance & Scalability: Load What You Need**
| **Feature** | **Maya** | **Angular / React / Vue / Next.js** |
|------------|---------|----------------------------------|
| **Initial Load Time** | Fast, loads only required MFEs | Can be slow due to static imports |
| **Code Splitting** | Automatic (`Maya.Load()`, `Maya.Route()`) | Needs Webpack, Lazy Loading, or SSR |
| **Multi-Tenant Support** | Built-in via namespaces | Requires separate build configurations |

‚úÖ **Why Maya is Simpler?**
- **Only loads what is needed**, reducing memory consumption.
- **No need for manual code splitting or SSR optimizations**.
- **Multi-tenancy is supported by design**, allowing multiple MFEs to coexist without conflicts.

---
## **6. Deployment & Maintenance: Modular vs. Monolithic**
| **Feature** | **Maya** | **Angular / React / Vue / Next.js** |
|------------|---------|----------------------------------|
| **Deployment Model** | Independent MFEs, separately deployable | Monolithic builds (except Next.js microservices) |
| **Versioning** | Version each MFE separately | Whole app versioned together |
| **Team Collaboration** | Teams work on independent MFEs | Requires coordination across the codebase |

‚úÖ **Why Maya is Simpler?**
- **MFEs can be updated independently** without affecting the entire application.
- **Easier for large teams to collaborate** without codebase conflicts.
- **No need to bundle everything into a single build** like Angular or Vue apps.

## **7. Real-World Use Case: How Maya Simplifies Development**
Imagine building a **dashboard application**:
- **React/Vue/Angular Approach**: Manages a component tree, handles state, optimizes rerenders, configures routing, and manually manages API calls.
- **Maya Approach**: Uses `Maya.Load()` to inject each dashboard section as an independent MFE, with automatic state management via `Maya.Store`, and event-driven updates via `Maya.Store.Publish()`.

### **Simpler Maya Workflow:**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **User clicks a button** ‚Üí `Maya.Route('dashboard/main?userId=12345')` loads the dashboard.
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Maya.Store calls API** ‚Üí `onLoad` fetches data dynamically.
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data is transformed and set in `Maya.Store`** ‚Üí Updates UI instantly.
4Ô∏è‚É£ **No prop drilling, no extra state management libraries, no rerender complexity.**

## **Conclusion: Why Choose Maya?**
Maya provides a **simpler, more flexible alternative** to Angular, React, Vue, and Next.js by offering:
‚úÖ **Dynamic slot-based MFE architecture** instead of rigid component trees.
‚úÖ **Simpler state management (`Maya.Store`) with auto-syncing inputs.**
‚úÖ **Pub/Sub event handling instead of prop drilling and state callbacks.**
‚úÖ **On-demand MFE loading instead of static rendering.**
‚úÖ **Independent deployments with micro front-end scalability.**

By leveraging Maya‚Äôs **event-driven, modular design**, developers can build **scalable, maintainable, and performant applications** with **less complexity and greater flexibility** than traditional frameworks. üöÄ
