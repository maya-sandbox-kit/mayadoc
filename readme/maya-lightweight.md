# üìÑ Whitepaper: Why Maya is Lightweight and Fast

## Abstract

**Maya** is a native micro front-end (MFE) framework designed from the ground up for **performance, modularity, and speed**. It offers developers a minimalistic yet powerful environment for building scalable and maintainable web applications. This whitepaper outlines the architectural decisions, technical innovations, and operational practices that make Maya both lightweight and fast.

---

## 1. Introduction

Modern web applications often become bloated due to unnecessary framework overhead, complex dependency chains, and tightly coupled components. Maya disrupts this trend by providing a **zero-config, native web component-based architecture** that is minimal in size, easy to load, and optimized for real-world performance.

---

## 2. Key Principles of Lightweight Design

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
Maya does not require React, Angular, or any runtime-heavy frontend frameworks. It relies on:
- Native **Custom Elements** for MFE encapsulation.
- Shadow DOM for style and scope isolation.
- **Mustache templates** for view rendering (simple, logic-free).

### üß± **No Build Process Required**
- No Webpack.
- No Babel.
- No transpilers or bundlers needed.
Each MFE is a folder with just an `index.js` and `main.html` (and optionally `detail.html`).

## 3. Performance-Focused Architecture

| Feature | Performance Benefit |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Dynamic Slot-Based Loading** | Only loads what's visible‚Äîimproves initial load time. |
| **On-Demand MFE Loading** | Uses `Maya.Route` and `Maya.Load` to fetch JS and HTML as needed. |
| **Scoped State & Shadow DOM** | No global memory bloat. MFEs don‚Äôt interfere with each other. |
| **Async Event Handling** | Pub/Sub and API calls are non-blocking by design. |
| **Per-MFE Cache Management** | Version-controlled via `version.json` with CDN cache invalidation. |

---

## 4. Lightweight by the Numbers

| Metric | Maya |
|--------|------|
| Base JS Size | < 100 KB |
| MFE Overhead | < 10 KB per MFE |
| Load Time (Single MFE) | < 50ms (avg on high-speed net) |
| Render Speed (Mustache-based) | Instant (< 5ms) |
| Dependencies | 0 external libs required (unless explicitly loaded) |

---

## 5. Fast UI Rendering

Maya uses **Mustache** for view rendering, which:
- Is logic-free (separation of concerns).
- Compiles fast.
- Outputs native HTML with no DOM diffing overhead.

This is further accelerated by:
- Lightweight render functions inside `MayaComponent`.
- Minimal re-rendering thanks to key-scoped store updates.

---

## 6. Minimal Memory Footprint

- Each MFE gets an **instance-scoped store**, avoiding global data collisions.
- Views are stateless and rehydrated only when required.
- Input-bound values are stored in a separate `self` tree, reducing noise in the main `data` object.

---

## 7. CDN-Friendly Deployment

Each MFE is served statically:
```
/mfe/<name>/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/index.js
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ view/main.html
```

- Assets are deployable on S3/CDN.
- Cache invalidation is handled via commit-based `version.json`.
- On reload, only updated MFEs are fetched; others are served from cache.

---

## 8. Real-World Optimization Examples

| Scenario | How Maya Optimizes |
|----------|--------------------|
| Modal Popups | Loaded only when opened (`Maya.Load`) |
| Detail Views | Fetched lazily using `?view=detail` |
| Filters/Forms | Self-contained input values; no rerender required |
| Notifications | Subscribed once via Pub/Sub, no polling |

---

## 9. Summary: Why Maya is Fast

| Trait | Benefit |
|-------|---------|
| **Native Web Standards** | No bloat, instant browser support. |
| **Component Isolation** | No cross-leakage or performance hits. |
| **Lazy Loading** | MFEs load only when needed. |
| **Zero Frameworks** | No runtime tax from React, Angular, etc. |
| **Efficient State Updates** | No DOM diffing; updates targeted via `SetData`. |
| **Slot-based Composition** | Ultra-low memory and CPU usage for nested MFEs. |

---

## 10. Conclusion

Maya achieves what many frameworks promise but fail to deliver: **true performance with minimal complexity**. Its architectural DNA is rooted in **speed-first thinking**, prioritizing what matters‚Äîfast load, fast interaction, and fast scaling.

Maya is not just fast by design‚Äîit's fast in practice.
